            <p class = 'bodyText'>Alcohol is all around us. It can be seen on sale at stores, sold at bars and restaurants, or perhaps in your household cabinet. You may even know someone who drinks alcohol on a daily basis. Close to 140 million people in the United States above the age of 12 have used alcohol in the past month. <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2019-nsduh-annual-national-report" class = 'citations'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Because of the widespread availablility of alcohol, most of us have probably seen someone drunk. This page will talk about alcohol use disorder (AUD), the diagnosis of AUD using the DSM-5, how alcohol works in the body, the short and long-term effects, and treatment.</p>

            <section id = 'aud' class = 'subtitle'>What is Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)?</section>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>AUD is a brain disorder where one drinks alcohol uncontrollably, despite causing harm to his or her own body. It can be split into mild, moderate, and severe categories. People with AUD often struggle to control their alcohol intake, leading to severe consequences, such as loss of a job and strained family relationships. Excessive alcohol usage and <b>binge drinking</b> (when a male takes 5 or more drinks within 2 hours, or when a female takes 4 or more drinks within 2 hours) have been shown to increase the risk of AUD. <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/understanding-alcohol-use-disorder" class = 'citations'><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243" class = 'citations'><sup>[3]</sup></a> </p>

            <p id = 'brightLink' class = 'bodyText'>(Show me an example of a person with AUD!)</p>
            <div class = 'example'>
                
                <p class = 'showMoreText'>John is in high school. He decided to stay after school with his friends, every day to go the 7-eleven to buy alcohol. Although he is underage, he wants alcohol so much that he uses a fake ID. After getting his hands on alcohol, he would stay away from home for hours on end, leaving his parents worried. His grades start slipping because he won't do his homework. Worst of all, when he is home on the weekends, he gets short-tempered and violent because he doesn't have access to alcohol at home.</p>
                <p class = 'showMoreTextCaption'>As seen above, John is so desparate for alcohol to the point he risks prosecution by using a fake ID. His use of alcohol has severe consequences for not only himself but for those around him.</p>
            </div>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>Around 414,000 adolescents struggle with AUD. Although this is only 1.2% of the entire adolescent population, studies have shown that <b>those who start drinking before the age of 15 are 5 times more likely to develop AUD compared to those who start drinking after 21.</b> Genetics may influence an individual's likelihood of developing AUD, along with the environment.<a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/understanding-alcohol-use-disorder" class = 'citations'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

            <p class = 'imageSubTitle'>Underage drinking may significantly increase your chances of developing AUD in the future.</p>

            <section id = 'dsm5diagnosis' class = 'subtitle'>DSM-5 diagnosis</section>
            <p class = 'bodyText'>Below are the official criteria of diagnosis of AUD, according to the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (DSM-5). Indication of 2-3 statements below indicate mild AUD, 4-5 statements indicate moderate AUD, while 6 or more is considered severe.</p>
            <div id = 'criteriaHolder'></div>

            <section id = 'effects' class = 'subtitle'>How alcohol works + its effects</section>
            <p class = 'bodyText'>Once alcohol is ingested, it acts both as a depressant (slowing down activity) as well as a stimulant. Alcohol decreases the levels of glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is responsible for increasing brain activity, while increasing the levels of GABA, another neurotransmitter that is responsible for calming everything down. Because of these fluctuating levels of neurotransmitters, alcohol basically <b>slows your brain down and affects the speed at which the brain could process information. <sup><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/10/16/what-alcohol-really-does-to-your-brain/?sh=b964755664ea" class = 'citations'>[4]</a></sup></b>As a result, a lot of physical symptoms happen, such as slurred speech, impaired coordination, and blurred vision. </p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>The liver can only break down so much alcohol per hour, and its rate can't be increased. <sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/why-does-alcohol-make-you-drunk" class = 'citations'>[5]</a><a href="https://www.colgate.edu/about/campus-services-and-resources/parent-alcohol-handbook/how-alcohol-works-body" class = 'citations'>[6]</a></sup> Because of this limitation, when you ingest a lot of alcohol in a short amount of time (also known as <i>binge drinking</i>), alcohol tends to accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to increased diameter of blood vessels. This can cause many problems, such as a rapid decrease in body temperature and low blood pressure. <sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/why-does-alcohol-make-you-drunk" class = 'citations'>[5]</a></sup> In more extreme cases, because alcohol slows down the nervous system, many other things can happen, such as cardiac arrest, confusion, passing out, and seizures. These are usually the symptoms of <b>alcohol overdose.</b></p>
